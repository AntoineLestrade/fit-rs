# Fit

Fit is a small crate used for reading and decoding FIT files generated by various sports devices. Currently it has only been designed specifically to read files produced by Garmin Edges 1000 and 520, and a Wahoo Elemnt. It will probably mostly work out of the box with other file sources, but will probably not work 100% perfectly unless it's a Garmin cycling computer. 

It currently *does not* support FIT files using custom developer fields.

## Installation


```toml
[dependencies]
fit = "0.4"
```

## Usage

```rust
extern crate env_logger;
extern crate fit;

use std::path::PathBuf;
use fit::Message;

fn main() {
    let filepath = PathBuf::from("fits/2913547417.fit");
    let f: Vec<Message> = fit::read(filepath);
}
```

A typical `Message` will look something like this:
```rust
Message { 
  kind: Record, 
  values: [
    DataField { field_num: 253, value: Time(1480856114) }, 
    DataField { field_num: 0,   value: F32(57.710945)   }, 
    DataField { field_num: 1,   value: F32(11.9945755)  }, 
    DataField { field_num: 5,   value: U32(1151)        }, 
    DataField { field_num: 29,  value: U32(0)           }, 
    DataField { field_num: 2,   value: U16(2394)        }, 
    DataField { field_num: 6,   value: U16(0)           }, 
    DataField { field_num: 7,   value: U16(0)           }, 
    DataField { field_num: 61,  value: U16(2234)        }, 
    DataField { field_num: 66,  value: I16(442)         }, 
    DataField { field_num: 3,   value: U8(113)          }, 
    DataField { field_num: 13,  value: I8(21)           }
  ], 
  dev_values: [] 
}

```

A `Value` enum is a simple wrapper around most rust primitive types, such as u16 or i64 or f32. 

Some things to watch out for:

 - speed is recorded as m/s, rather than kph.
